# Minesweeper3D
Acting as a spiritual successor to our previous Minesweeper project this will aim to take the game to a whole new level.

*For an overview of the aim of the game please refer to our other project readme found [here](https://github.com/PixelApocalypse/Minesweeper)*

## Features
This game will be unlike almost any other Minesweeper you can find as it is taking place in 3d space with multiple axis movement around the grid and even the ability to move inside and get a better look.

Some note worthy features are as follows:
 - Fully remappable control scheme
 - Ambient music and sound effects isolated on individual channels that can be independently controlled in volume
 - World Space display for numbers
 - Six preset camera locations around the grid that you can easily switch between
 - Ability to change wasd from rotating to more fp control style. 
 - Returning **Experimental** difficulty setting from past project.
 
Additionally we have the potential to add a lot of other neat features and graphical enhancements after the more minimalistic structure is in place. We could even add modding support to some extent letting you set whatever textures you would like for the various elements. 

## Notes
Feel free to fork the project and work on your own changes and propose them to us!
